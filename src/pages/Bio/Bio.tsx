                <p className='px-16'>
                    Ever since I was a child, I have been fascinated by the weather. You're probably wondering why this matters
                    since I am a software engineer. Well, it gave me a strong passion for learning and led me to be incredibly self-motivated. 
                    It all began with a colorful temperature map on the news when I was four years old. Since then, I have been obsessed with
                    tornadoes, hurricanes, and especially snow (though hodograph data is fun to read). If you know anything about meteorology, I
                    was the kid looking at the 06Z GFS run each night before bed, or morning if I was tired. I've been called upon numerous times
                    to give a forecast for family events and sports games, and even have friends randomly texting me if it's going to rain tomorrow 
                    (which I just look at the forecast like they could, but I wouldn't ever tell them that ;) ) However, all of this 
                    also led me to finding software. Through freaking out each time I analyzed a numerical weather model and atmospheric dynamics 
                    tool, I began to appreciate software at a deeper level. This, as well as my father, helped me to choose to pursue an 
                    academic career in computer science. From my very first "Hello, World!" program, I have become increasingly drawn to the 
                    diversity and scope of practice that software engineering has. I truly believe the saying "You can do anything if you 
                    put your mind to it." is especially true when it comes to software, and I am excited to be a part of the software movement
                    in my future career.
